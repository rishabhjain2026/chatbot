# My Chatbot Project

## Overview

This is a simple AI-powered chatbot project. Initially, I attempted to build it using **LangChain**, but I found it difficult to set up and work with. To simplify development, I switched to using **OpenRouter**'s API to generate responses from AI models.  

The chatbot takes user input and returns AI-generated replies dynamically.
